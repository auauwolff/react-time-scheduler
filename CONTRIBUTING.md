   - Click the "Fork" button in the top right

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-time-scheduler.git
   cd react-time-scheduler
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   This will open the example app at http://localhost:5173

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Get latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- **Write code**: Follow the existing code style
- **Add tests**: If applicable
- **Update types**: Ensure TypeScript types are correct
- **Document**: Update JSDoc comments and README if needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Type checking
pnpm run type-check

# Linting
pnpm run lint

# Build the library
pnpm run build

# Test in the example app
pnpm run dev
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We use conventional commits. Please follow this format:

```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>

git commit -m "feat: add time zone selector"
git commit -m "fix: correct event overlap calculation"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new prop"
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### 5. Push to Your Fork

git push origin feature/amazing-feature
```

## Component Guidelines

### Props
- All props should have TypeScript types
- Optional props should have sensible defaults
- Document props with JSDoc comments

### State Management
- Keep state minimal
- Prefer derived state when possible
- Use controlled/uncontrolled pattern appropriately

### Styling
- Use Material-UI components and theme
- Avoid inline styles when possible
- Keep styles customizable through props

## API Design Principles

1. **Flexibility**: Users should be able to customize appearance and behavior
2. **Simplicity**: Common use cases should be simple
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
4. **Performance**: Minimize re-renders and optimize for large datasets
5. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines

## Testing Guidelines

When adding new features:

1. Test with different data sizes
2. Test with edge cases (empty data, single item, etc.)
3. Test different prop combinations
4. Verify TypeScript types work correctly

## Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add JSDoc comments for new props
- Update examples if needed
- Add to CHANGELOG.md
